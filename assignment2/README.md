#### What is Backpropagation? 

> Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate a gradient that is needed in the calculation of the weights to be used in the network. It is commonly used to train deep neural networks, a term referring to neural networks with more than one hidden layer — Source Wikipedia

The goal of backpropagation algorithm is to adjust the weights of a Neural network while training. It is the most widely used approach to train Neural networks.

#### Forward Pass

The **"forward pass"** refers to calculation process, values of the output layers from the inputs data. It's traversing through all neurons from first to last layer.

#### Backward pass 

The goal in backpropagation is to update each of the weights in the network so that they cause the actual output to be closer to the target output, thereby minimizing the error of each output neuron and hence the whole network as well.
